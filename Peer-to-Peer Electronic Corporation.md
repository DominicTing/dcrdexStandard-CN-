### 早期的互联网十分神奇：出现了超越民族国家边界的全球分散社会的可能性，人们在其之中自由共享数据。

在当时，这是技术专家和学术界的领地。直到 1990 年代初期所谓的永恒九月，历史将它推向了主流，并且正如新技术诞生那样，导致了互联网泡沫，Web 2.0 就是从中诞生的：今天的 Facebook、谷歌等数字新封建主义和硅谷科技巨头。

随后出现的去中心化和点对点加密与比特币一起出现，并通过一系列泡沫和 2017 年的狂暴牛将其从边缘推向主流，在许多方面让人想起互联网的早期阶段。

比特币本质上是一种流氓货币工具，一个不受监管的资本流动通道，一种在传统和遗留框架和结构的管辖范围之外进行在线商业的手段（因此，在精神上非常自由，与整个90年代和新世纪初期的密码朋克和黑客思想产生共鸣）。比特币本身更像是一种特别的启发式或非常聪明的黑客攻击，它复制了一些经济原理，人为地创造了数字稀缺性和参与者激励的博弈论一致性。

在概念、基本假设甚至美学上与新反动运动和 Urbit 项目有些相似，比特币同样以其功能保守简单性脱颖而出。

所有这些可能都是必要的手段，以证明在没有任何管理控制中心点（因此也没有失败）或直接人为干预的情况下，将现实世界的价值注入到去中心化网络中流通的技术可能性。

这种媒介应该能够及时大幅提高配置资本的效率和精确度。比特币确实选择了正确的时机出现，并在 2008 年经济危机之后乘势而上。当我们进入另一场经济危机时，是时候再次

### 反思那件事了。

此后，这一事件引发了很多关于如何充分建模和设计有效的自我调节市场（或重新发现“看不见的手”）的理论。正如 2008 年所揭示的那样，金融资本主义已经达到了抽象复杂的程度，可能会失控，并且我们能够有效地管理这种组织的复杂性（一直在应用关于市场的信念和公理，这些信念和公理不再适用并且似乎更多地植根于意识形态而不是理论上基于任何参考点到运动中的现实） .


## 重新想象金钱

让我们稍微回顾一下：钱是什么？

一个简单的答案是将自由浮动的抽象债务为事物之间的普遍等价衡量标准，这样它就可以在陌生人之间进行商品交易，否则他们既不认识也不信任对方。交易的东西之一也是劳动力，因此货币也具有分配生产性工作的功能。另一方面，价格充当沟通供求关系的信息系统：什么供过于求，什么需要更多生产。因此，通过信息论（在哈耶克著作中发展起来的一种思路）的视角可以更好地理解货币。

然而，当金本位在 70 年代初期被放弃时，这种债务体现在对美国经济的信任中（因此，法定货币，就这样吧）—— 这反过来又赋予了国家直接产生这种抽象债务的权力按下按钮，没有任何理由或支持它。那样的话，基本上就是从未来借钱，押注在那个阴暗、不确定的未来的某个时候偿还那笔债务。这反过来又创造了一个过度活跃的社会，为了在未来偿还过去的债务，社会必须不断扩张。


## 比特币面临的挑战

比特币 —— 具有固定、可预测供应的点对点现金，但并不真的具备可互换性，因为分类账保留硬币的防篡改审计跟踪 —— 使得将一些硬币列入黑名单成为可能，而且通常旧硬币可信度超过新铸造的。（因此，比特币极简主义模因“1 BTC = 1 BTC”从字面上看并不正确。）

然而，与法定电子货币不同的是，如果大规模采用，比特币将存在可扩展性问题——更不用说过去在某些专制司法管辖区中持续出现的挖矿集中化威胁（因此，它也具有地缘政治成分）。

一些加密货币的出现是为了尝试迭代比特币的总体思想，解决它的一些缺点：例如， Monero是匿名的、不可追踪的和抗ASIC。

总的来说，在比特币之后发展起来的企业或项目大多是（并且仍然是）推进和重新利用共识驱动区块链的一般概念（例如，以太坊为其配备代码执行环境以运行存储的更复杂的操作在区块链本身的代码中，等等）

迭代比特币的尝试可以分为许多类别，例如：

- 隐私：Monero、Decred、ZCash 等 - 涉及复杂的加密协议，这些协议本质上是最“cypherpunk”的。
- 可扩展性：Mimblewimble（例如 Grin、BEAM）和闪电网络
- PoW 挖矿中心化和垄断形成带来的预防威胁：Monero（具有抗 ASIC 的 RandomX）、Decred 的混合 PoW/PoS 是对抗矿工中心化的不同方法（尤其是最近提高奖励率的举措）

这些都是具体的改进领域 —— 但还有更全面、更系统的问题困扰着比特币，而这些问题往往被比特币社区所忽视。比特币最初被设想为一个完全去中心化的系统，但它已经存在并在一个由中心化和孤立的实体和服务组成的生态系统中运行，因此，它构成了重新中心化和被捕获的威胁。Decred 本身在另一个方向上采用了比特币的一般前提，它构成了利益相关者的 DAO，利益相关者拥有系统中的股份（因此，直接激励通过增加保护它的系统的价值来增加它们的价值）。Decred 旨在通过调整网络参与者和参与者的激励和利益来减少或消除利益冲突和硬分叉。Decred 将治理的主要方面直接纳入协议，非常注重社区投入以及可持续的资金以及未来发展。

## 去中心化整个生态系统

> “我很想说 decred 是最好的比特币” - Chris DeRose

比特币存在于一个重叠和交织的再中心化趋势的生态系统中，其治理和发展轨迹由 Blockstream 等传统公司结构驱动。实际上，比特币主要是通过托管经纪人和中心化交易所购买和交易的，这需要个人身份验证并通过 KYC/AML 程序。这本身在很多方面都违背了比特币本应实现的目的（因为在中心化交易所交易去中心化资产毫无意义，除非以其传统形式模拟市场动态）。不要忽视或削弱比特币在将分布式点对点去中心化范例从边缘拉入主流方面所做的贡献，而是询问比特币是否可以根据其早期的精神变得更像比特币。

以下是生态系统如何以其当前类似联盟的形式运作的简要概述：

What if the centralized entities could be replaced with decentralized ones? And decentralized assets circulate within a decentralized ecosystem composed of loosely coupled independent subsystems resistant to capture, protecting it from re-centralizing effects.


This is what Decred, one such undertaking in the cryptosphere aims to accomplish. An analogy could be drawn in how there are many various distributions based on the Linux kernel which is itself free but surrounded by proprietary software, whereas Decred is more like a BSD system where the kernel, the distribution, and all packages exist as a single whole and are free software (free as in free speech, not free beer).

And it is under such circumstances of decentralization and the flexible properties of the relationships between the parts in the system which set the conditions under which emergence appears. Decred is an undertaking pushing towards such an alternative to the whole "operating system" of corporations in setting up something much more resilient and robust in the sense of a complex adaptive system.

From Cryptocurrency to Cryptocapital

"A complex mechanism made of coins", generated by OpenAI's DALL-E 2
We should either accept bitcoin within an ecosystem of centralized entities under the constant threat of capture or push things further in the other way to try to decentralize the whole ecosystem in our efforts to build an operating system for a different kind of market (and/or other kinds) economy. Ambitious, perhaps even grandiose, but given the current state of affairs, absolutely necessary (and the proverb says, necessity is the mother of invention).

We look at Decred as a form of organization, or what is more commonly known in the space, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) - an electronic peer-to-peer corporation (in lieu of Satoshi's "peer-to-peer electronic cash").

While left-wing criticism of capitalism, alerting us to the inequality existing in society today is pertinent, even though their solutions, ranging from the centrally planned economy of state capitalism to nowadays more inauthentic lumpen alt-left shouts to "eat the rich!". These do have a lot of resonance in terms of the reality of those issues we're facing, the solution however must be in universalizing the tremendous productive potential of capital and channeling its productive capacity towards social good.

In Decred's vision of a digital economy, users, workers and customers altogether benefit from the growth of value accumulated in the network itself as the functions of currency and capital are joined in working together (rather than divorcing price from value). Much of the dissatisfaction in society today is to do with the lack of access to the means of production and the alienation which follows from not being directly involved in the creation of value (but having to sell one's labor).

We’ve come to generally associate corporations with unscrupulous profiteering and as something malignant or even evil, overlooking its raison d’etre as a general organizational concept. The Industrial Revolution, as any technological revolution does, changed how labor is organized and tremendously accelerated productivity thereby. Likewise, today’s technological revolution enables the functional re-purposing (or “deterritorialization”) of old concepts in new contexts, often leading to them changing in nature.

But what was the true "revolution" in the Industrial Revolution? It was the magic moment when the British government decided that they would grant second-order sovereignty to companies and create a legal entity whereby a group of people could be aligned, with common capital and people working for it within a legal structure. Before that, people were basically limited to small groups of people that could trust each other. And now suddenly there was this entity that could glue people and capital together with an incentive structure where everyone’s incentives were in line.

So this one innovation by the British government enabled that incredible boom in terms of not just coming up with inventions, but making them great and getting them into people’s hands. It's still underappreciated how valuable that was. The most important “invention” of the industrial era was not any specific tech invention, but the “meta-invention” that accelerated all other inventions; this can also be called incentive alignment, and it’s the thing Decred seems to get right. What generated the tremendous pace of advancement in the Industrial Revolution was a form of incentive alignment that allowed people who otherwise do not trust each other to work together for the same goal. However, Decred does this in a decentralized way and not through a State imposed fictitious person, which is crucial.

We feel as if these entities, called corporations, have, due to their acquired legal entity status, begun to become the principal “subjects” driving history forward. It is as if they had intelligence and an agency of their own. One of the pioneers of the field of artificial intelligence, Professor Stuart J. Russel, has recently gone so far as to describe corporations as artificial intelligences that have taken over.

“[...] we don't have to look forward to a time when AI systems take over the world: they already have and they’re called corporations. That corporations happen to be using people as components right now, but they are effectively algorithmic machines and their optimizing an objective which is quarterly profit that isn't aligned with the overall well-being of the human race [...] that's one way of thinking about what's going on with we corporations but I think [...] that there are there many systems in the real world where we've sort of prematurely fixed on the objective and then decoupled the machine from those they’re supposed to be serving and I think you see this with the government. Government is supposed to be a machine that serves people but instead it tends to be taken over by people who have their own objective and use the government to optimize that objective regardless of what people want.” (Professor Stuart J. Russell, on the AI Podcast with Lex Fridman, Dec 9, 2018, ~46:50)
Professor Stuart J. Russell uses the analogy of “algorithmic machines” running on wetware to point to what he sees as two problems with the, let’s call it, government-corporation complex:

1. a premature fixation of objective (quarterly profits);

2. the “machine” becomes “decoupled” from those it was originally meant to serve.

Since corporations exist within the legal framework provided by the government. The corporation has to optimize its objective, and sometimes this leads to behaviors that are taking advantage of the “glitches” of the environment (using tax loopholes, etc.) In this way of seeing things, we eliminate any moralistic language (“corruption, evil”...), and see aberrations in a purely systemic way: we recognize the same set of problems, but we have a better shot at actually developing alternatives to solve them. Moralism is ineffective and should be replaced by systems thinking. “Don’t be evil” should be replaced by “can’t be evil”.


We should see the corporation as a step forward from the close-knit group of friends who trust each other and run a business together based on trust, to something that can scale better. Such groups, or families, can of course collaborate without having to use any special organization, but this model cannot scale. In order to scale, we need something like a corporate entity. Without it, strangers could not collaborate and capital could not be joined with labor to accelerate progress.

The problem with the traditional corporation is not where we would assume to find it. It is not that there is a need for more regulation. It is that the very regulations accelerate the problems because these “artificially intelligent” corporations learn to evade them, while the average Joe cannot afford to do the same. What an “electronic peer-to-peer corporation” is able to do, is to circumvent this duality between the state and the corporate, and create an entity that gives the stakeholders direct power (not delegated). A user can also be a stakeholder and can also be a member of an anonymous global “board of directors”.  In the traditional corporate framework, the fragmentation between these aspects causes a chasm between what users want, what shareholders want, and what the board of directors wants.


Uniting Currency and Capital
A personal recollection: I remember that while employed at a regular job I didn’t like too much, at a small company, I was actively desiring the company to have just enough business not to fail. If it had too much business, I would have to work more, but for the same pay. If it had too little, it could risk closing and I would lose my job. But isn’t it evident that there’s something wrong with this picture? Wouldn’t I feel differently if I was receiving a stake in the company?

The misaligned (or perverse) incentives and the quantitative medium through which the value of workers’ labor is valued and exchanged leads to what Marx termed alienation. But if currency and capital are coupled as instruments of direct participation (in some such digital cooperative corporations) in both the work and its fruits and outcomes, then that would better ground motivations and psychologically enable different modes of coherent economic behavior.

The key to achieving this new type of organization and what it would mean first became clear to me when I read Joel Monegro of Placeholder VC’s remarks, it was a veritable eureka moment (link to a video presentation of his ideas): governance in crypto allows for the emergence of something more than “currency”: it allows for the emergence of crypto capital. And what is capital? Simply put, capital is the power to productively organize labor and mobilize the means of production toward the desired outcome.


“Separating currency and capital leads to concentration. Modern capitalism keeps currency and capital separate. Capital appreciates over time while currencies depreciate in time, leading to a massive concentration of wealth and power.” (Joel Monegro, 14:15)
What something like Decred makes possible then is the above mentioned “superpower” of formal incentive alignment, but without having to exist within a legal framework that depends on extensive institutional bureaucracies and specialized human expertise to run it (and therefrom, being cumbersome, often inefficient and susceptible to outside influences, lobbying, human error and bias).

It’s naive to see the rigged game situation of the current economy solely in terms of “corrupt individuals” and “bad apples” - instead, the systemic reasons that condition and underlie this state of affairs much be looked at more closely. A corporation, by definition, works to optimize its “reward function”, which is usually defined in terms of quarterly profits - and as such, it has to use all the means available to it towards that goal. So, it’s only rational to employ lobbying, various ways of evading taxes, etc.

In Decred, the functions of currency (as a unit of accounting and means of exchange) and capital (as the capacity to productively organize labor) are coupled together - those working for the Decred ecosystem, for example, are paid in the system’s native token, which is also used as voting stake, allowing the holder to participate in the decision-making processes which set the course for future development. Thereby making stakeholders directly responsible for the outcomes of their choices, decisions, and actions, instead of delegating those responsibilities to a central bank, government institution or some panel of narrow experts (whose interests may not always coincide with those of the people they are expected to represent and act in the interest of and who too often do not carry the burdens of the kinds of risks they might take).

“Separating currency and capital leads to concentration. Modern capitalism keeps currency and capital separate. Capital appreciates over time while currencies depreciate in time, leading to a massive concentration of wealth and power.” (14:15)
While agreeing with the left-wing critique of modern-day financial capitalism and the disproportionate asymmetries of inequality it creates, the solution may lie in the coupling back of price and value, currency and capital, rather than in stricter and more crippling regulations, cumbersome bureaucracies, and increased state intervention.

“Most people live their lives in currency, and few people live their lives in the capital. Currencies tend to lose value in time, while capital tends to appreciate in time. ” (15:00)
At the time of writing this, we are witnessing unprecedented division in society. The division is usually described as the divide between the Left and the Right, or the have and the have-not, the socialists, and the capitalists. But this battle is fought within the system that created it, instead of outside of it. This system, corporatism, will not be overcome by anarchy or by rage, but by something that is as effective, as productive (if not more) than the corporation, but without its deadlocks. It seems to me the idea of uniting currency and capital, stake and wage, and skin-in-the-game with sovereignty steps in a direction that satisfies both sides, and creates a self-directed, autonomous collective that can collaborate across borders.

Now try to imagine how a society runs on this “operating system”, instead of the corporatist one. I feel drawn to this vision.
